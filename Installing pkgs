When correcting programming problems 
such as missing gems and bundle versions
make sure to write the programming code
like the following:

Example instead of 
gem install simplecov-0.18.2
You have to write;
gem install simplecov -v 0.18.2

For some reason I've noticed a lot of 
people do not explain this which may be 
something they don't think about or most
programmers already know but I know this
can be helpful for a lot of people that
are still getting programming errors or
having a difficult time installing the
pkgs that they need to install.
