When correcting programming problems 
such as missing gems and bundle versions
make sure to write the programming code
like the following:

Example instead of 
gem install simplecov-0.18.2
You have to write;
gem install simplecov -v 0.18.2

For some reason I've noticed a lot of 
people do not explain this which may be 
something they don't think about or most
programmers already know but I know this
can be helpful for a lot of people that
are still getting programming errors or
having a difficult time installing the
pkgs that they need to install.

Here's the list of following gems and
the correct coding for adding them:

gem install yard -v 0.9.26
gem install pry-byebug -v 3.9.0
Which installed 5 gems for me.
gem install octokit -v 4.21.0
Which installed 15 gems for me.
gem install memory_profiler -v 1.0.0
Which installed 1 gem.
gem install ruby-prof -v 1.4.2
Which installed 1 gem.

gem install factory_bot_rails -v 6.2.0
Which tried to install multiple things but the
extension connection failed. So I followed
these instructions:

gem install nokogiri -- \
    --use-system-libraries \
    --with-xml2-lib=/path/to/builds/lib \
    --with-xml2-include=/path/to/builds/include/libxml2 \
    --with-xslt-lib=/path/to/builds/lib \
    --with-xslt-include=/path/to/builds/include

By copying and pasting that whole path
and then was able to successfully install
all of my factory bot rails by once more 
entering:

gem install factory_bot_rails -v 6.2.0
and 13 gems were installed altogether.
gem install fivemat -v 1.3.7
Installed 1 gem.
gem install rake -v 13.0.6
Installed 1 gem.
gem install rspec-rails -v 5.0.1
Installed 6 gems.
gem install rspec-rerun -v 1.1.0
Which installed 2 gems.
gem install rubocop -v 1.19.0
Installed 9 gems.
gem install timecop -v 0.9.4
Installed 1 gem.
gem install activerecord -v 6.1.4
2 gems were installed.
gem install bcrypt -v 3.1.16
1 gem installed.
gem install jsobfu -v 0.4.2
2 gems.

You get the picture. I will update further
if need be. Please comment if this helps or
if you can help and have more experience.
Thank you
